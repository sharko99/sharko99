Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a coder, gamer, and all-around tech enthusiast. I spend my days (and nights) working with web tech (HTML, PHP, JavaScript), and gaming engines (Unity and Unreal). Whether I'm whipping up scripts in C# and C++, or diving deep into game design, I'm all about turning cool ideas into even cooler realities. If you're into web dev, gaming, or just love nerding out about tech, let's chat!
